# MachineVisionPlay
Trying out OpenCV and playing/learning to do machine vision 

Going through the long process of getting OpenCV on my Raspberry Pi and then  
as a result will try to learn it. 

I have a HQ Camera so I will try to see what I can do with it.  

Will start small with some small recognition and then try to see about  
trying to integrate some sort of autonomy to the drone. 

This will be a nice opportunity to learn more about Python, Machine Vision  
and perhaps some basic machine learning, who knows. 

Might not get too far into it right now. Will pivot on first Monday of May  
to continue my process of one topic of learning per month. May look at  
getting back into this during July/August time.
